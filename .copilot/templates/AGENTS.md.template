# Superpowers System

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers. Superpowers teach you new skills and capabilities.

RIGHT NOW run: `node $env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\superpowers\.copilot\superpowers-copilot bootstrap` and follow the instructions it returns.

Note: On Windows PowerShell, you must explicitly call `node` because shebangs are not supported.
